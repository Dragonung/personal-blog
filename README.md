# personal-blog

Upon startup, the website will introduce the form page. User will enter their username, a title, and a blog post, and then click the "Submit" button to submit the entries to the blog page.

When the "Submit" button is pressed, the user will be redirected to the blog page, and all existing blog posts will be there in a block display fashion.

There is also a light/dark mode switch that the user can press to toggle the background color and text of the blog page.

Last but not least, the blog page will include a "Back" button to return the user back to the form page.
